# Calculator
A basic calculator test created in python IDLE. 
Try using with python IDLE and I would appreciate if you let me know if it works and if you have any issues. 
This is my first project using Python and was built to test myself on the basics. 
For syntax + adds, - subtracts, / divides, * multiplies, % finds the modulus and ^ is for indices or power. 
The calculator has a y, n continue function where inputting y allows further calculations with the answer gained and n restarts while typing end stops the program. 
An error with syntax will reset however an error with putting in non numbers in the number 1 or number 2 input will stop the program as will putting in anything aside from y or n for continue however you will receive an error message. 

Thanks in advance for any help or advice given.
